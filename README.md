# emergency-number
**Emergency Number** is an app that makes it easier to communicate with emergency services.

## The Idea
The project originated from the contest to create application that will help deaf-mute people to contact emergency services. We wanted to take it from there and extend the functionality to aid everyone in need of urgent help.

## Features
The main goal is to make asking for help accessible and intuitive for everyone, even someone with disability or uncertain of current location. We are trying to achieve that with the following...
### Pictograms
Choose what happened from a tree-based category list, displayed as pictograms + text for accessibility.

### Location updates
Let the app determine where you are or put in the address yourself.

### Give additional information
You can continue conversation with the operator to answer question or follow instructions.
